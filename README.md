## Want to Write A Tutorial?
If you would like to help me out and write a tutorial, either from one above or one you come up with that you think is needed, simply create an Issue detailing what you want the tutorial to cover and (anytime you think of it), it's outline. This allows people to talk about what the tutorial should or shouldn't include.

Since I don't have a system up for creating tutorials on the zite, you will have to do it through Github for now. Simply fork this repository and create your tutorial in a markdown file in the `tutorials` directory. Once you have completed the tutorial, create a pull request. Then, the tutorial will go through a review for corrections, additions, deletions, etc. If the people involved agree that the tutorial is well enough to be published, I will merge the pull request.
